# SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) is a family of cryptographic hash functions 
# used to generate hash values for digital data. There are different versions 
# of SHA, such as SHA-1, SHA-256, and SHA-512, each with a different output 
# size and level of security.

# To generate a SHA hash code, you would need to choose a specific version of SHA 
# and input the data that you want to hash. The output would be a fixed-length 
# string of characters that represents the hash value of the input data.
